Python code for a simple word game: consider the word pair (teach, peace), that 1) shares its inside characters, and 2) is the same length (I discovered it from [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/DesignPorn/comments/aifptw/teach_peace/) reddit post).

I was curious about the density of such word pairs in common texts. The code below performs analysis on these kinds of word pairs.
